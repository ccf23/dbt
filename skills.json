Reality is as it is (the facts about the past and the present are the facts, even if you don’t like them). There are limitations on the future for everyone (but only realistic limitations need to be accepted). Everything has a cause (including events and situations that cause you pain and suffering). Life can be worth living even with painful events in it. WHY ACCEPT REALITY? Rejecting reality does not change reality. Changing reality requires first accepting reality. Pain can’t be avoided; it is nature’s way of signaling that something is wrong. Rejecting reality turns pain into suffering. Refusing to accept reality can keep you stuck in unhappiness, bitterness, anger, sadness, shame, or other painful emotions. Acceptance may lead to sadness, but deep calmness usually follows.
