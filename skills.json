Control your attention, but not what you see. Push away nothing. Cling to nothing. Practice wordless watching by watching your thoughts come into your mind and let them slip right by like clouds in the sky. Notice each feeling, rising and falling, like waves in the ocean. Observe both inside and outside yourself. DESCRIBE: Put words on the experience. When a feeling or thought arises, or you do something, acknowledge it. Throw yourself completely into activities of the current moment. Do not separate yourself from what is going on in the moment (dancing, cleaning, talking to a friend, feeling happy or feeling sad). Label what you observe. Put a name on your feelings. Label a thought as just a thought, a feeling as just a feeling, an action as just an action. unglue your interpretations and opinions from the facts. Describe the “who, what, when, and where” that you observe. Just the facts. Remember, if you can’t observe it through your senses, you can’t describe it. PARTICIPATE: Throw yourself completely into activities of the current moment. Do not separate yourself from what is going on in the moment (dancing, cleaning, talking to a friend, feeling happy or feeling sad). PARTICIPATE: Throw yourself completely into activities of the current moment. Do not separate yourself from what is going on in the moment (dancing, cleaning, talking to a friend, feeling happy or feeling sad).

Be completely present to this one moment. Do one thing at a time. Notice the desire to be half-present, to be somewhere else, to go somewhere else in your mind, to do something else, to multitask— and then come back to one thing at a time.  Let go of distractions. If other actions, or other thoughts, or strong feelings distract you, go back to what you are doing—again, and again, and again. concentrate your mind. If you find you are doing two things at once, stop —go back to one thing at a time (the opposite of multitasking!). EFFECTIVELY:  Be mindful of your goals in the situation, and do what is necessary to achieve them. Focus on what works. (Don’t let emotion mind get in the way of being effective). Play by the rules. Act as skillfully as you can. Do what is needed for the situation you are in—not the situation you wish you were in; not the one that is fair; not the one that is more comfortable.
